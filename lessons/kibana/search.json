# Hello! This is the Kibana Dev tools console, we'll use this to interact with Elasticsearch


# We now have about 20k products in the index!
# Let's search for them.

#--------------------------------------
# Basic Search: Querying documents with GET

# Find *all* documents

GET /products_index/product/_search

GET /products_index/product/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}

# Let's find all necklaces!
GET /products/product/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "name": "necklace"
    }
  }
